# KNN visualizer

First JavaScript project! A side project made during the virus to expand my frontend skills.

The intent of this project is to visualy present the KNN algorithm.
K nearest neighbour(KNN) is a classification algorithm, which
means that it assigns a class to an unknown object with known parameters from a provided data set consisting of objects with known parameters and their
classes. KNN works by searching the provided data set for K objects closest to the unclassified object and than counting which class occurs most
frequently among the K nearest neighbours, where K is the number of how many nearest objects shall be counted. The class that occurs most frequently is
assigned to the unknown object.
